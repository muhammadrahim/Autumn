To run:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

Site will be available at: `localhost:8761/login`

Note that there is some misconfiguration for the `/design` screen which causes the application to break - I will eventually fix this...

This project involves a h2 database, HATEOS (level 4 REST), Angular.js & security. It is a standard web application with REST endpoints.
